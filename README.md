# Mastering Docker 
[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/244990d99454435689933a467531ba10)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/xmnchild/popeye?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=xmnchild/popeye&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

The aim of this project was to deploy a strawpoll using different containers. Each container uses a single dockerfile and different technologies. The whole application is orchestrated by docker-compose.



## Installation

```bash
docker-compose build 
docker-compose run
```
